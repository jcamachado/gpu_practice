SETUP (Ubuntu 22): 
Make sure cmake is properly installed.
Make sure assimp is installed and that its include is placed inside the assimp/ folder in lib/
    - Open terminal on working directory root
    - cd build/
    - cmake ..
    - Just build it and run! If you are using vscode, the MS C/C++ plugins are sufficient to run it.


PS: For some reason, on my setup, it cd to ./build/ and gives path error for assets. If it happens, just rerun from cd ..
