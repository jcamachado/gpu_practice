OPTICAL NOTION 
The higher the field of view, the smaller objects will appear. 45o degrees FoV makes a cube looks larger then a 90o degrees FoV.

CAMERA
row, yaw and pitch: Are the axis (plane) that should rotate certain object.
Imagine an airplane:
pointing front (roll)
pointing east (pitch)
pointing down (yaw) 

MATRIX MATH
Matrix multiplication order for objects onto the screen
//position
//obj coords           placed in context           camera                what we see
//local   -----model----> world ------------view--> view ---projection--> clip   
//Multiplication must be transformation * model * position
//projection * view * model * position 
//transformation multiplication order is scale, rotate, translate 

cross function, to get the ortogonal vector between 2 vectors
