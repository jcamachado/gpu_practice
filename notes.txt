location
/etc/vulkan/icd.d/ or /usr/share/vulkan/icd.d 	Vulkan driver JSON manifest file, which is not modified by the SDK installer.

GLSLC
Location: /usr/local/bin/glslc
Does not recognise .vs and .fs. But recognized .vs .fs

In tutorial, device, pipeline, window and maybe other artifacts are called lve_filename.ext. Ex: lve_window.cpp.
I'm removing its prefix to be generic, but applied them to classes. But instead of lve, i'm using uffdejavu for namespace and UD for 
classes prefix.

In vulkan, it happens many times that instead of calling many parameters, we create a struct and refer to its pointer.

Required extensions are defined by glfw to display content
